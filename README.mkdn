bgs - back ground setter
========================
`bgs` is an extremely fast and small background setter for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build bgs you need the `Xlib` and `Imlib2` header files.


Installation
------------
Edit `config.mk` to match your local setup (bgs is installed into
the `/usr/local` namespace, with Xinerama support enabled by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install `bgs` (if
necessary as root):

    # make clean install


Running bgs
-----------

### run once:

supposing `bgs` is installed,

    $ bgs /path/to/image

will rescale the image to fit the screen.

    $ bgs -c /path/to/image

will center the image on the screen.

    $ bgs -s /path/to/image

will stretch the image to fill the screen.

Given more than one image, `bgs` will set the background of each monitor
(if multiple monitors are present) to the corresponding image respectively.

..more is there, read the man page.

---

In order to connect `bgs` to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    $ DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 bgs <image> &

(This will start `bgs` on display `:1` of the host `foo.bar`.)

---

### run on X startup:

Add the following line to your `~/.xinitrc` to start `bgs` using `startx`:

    bgs <image> &
